          While it is important to have naturally occurring sugars in your diet,
          many foods contain harmful added sugars that contain no nutritional
          value. According to a study conducted by the University of Florida,
          the brain releases heroin-like chemicals called endogenous opioids
          when an individual indulges on sweet, salty or fatty foods.

              source healthier alternatives.
